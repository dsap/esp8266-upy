# This use the font file veram_m15.bin available on the FreeType_generator Project
# located at https://github.com/mchobby/freetype-generator
#
# In this sample we will:
# * Use the font drawer on the ILI934x driver, This approach is quite slower
#   compare to the print() function because is draws to the LCD pixel per pixel
