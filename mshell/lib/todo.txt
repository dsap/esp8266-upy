TODO List
=========

* mshell -> summary of commands + example. One line per command!
* mshell -> fully support sub-directory (cd, pwd)
* mshell -> help : also open mshell.txt from /lib
* mshell -> ls : with paging & multi columns
* mshell -> ls : display filesize?
* mshell -> more : cat with paging
* mshell -> reboot
* mshell -> ./xxx : execute/reexcute a python script
* mshell -> free : gc.collect + display available mem.
* mshell -> find : find a file (find zumo)

* hexview.py -> View content of file as HEX

* wifi.py -> on/off/configure
* get.py -> get a file over wifi
* ifconfig.py -> display configuration

Idea: Receive a file over the REPL line (with cat from host: cat file > /dev/ttyACM0 )
