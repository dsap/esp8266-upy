# Measuring temperature with the NON-CONTACT IR temperature sensor

MOD-IR-TEMP is an infra red thermometer based on Melexis MLX90614BAA chip.

The MLX90614BAA is factory calibrated in wide temperature range:
* -40 to 125 °C for sensor temperature and
* -70 to 380 °C for object temperature.
* the BAA version is for medical application and offers a precision of 0.02°C resolution (in a restricted range).

The MLX90614BAA offers the following precision the medical coverage

The precision also depend of temperature range measured as demonstrates the following image.

# wiring

In this example, we just wired the MOD-IR-TEMP UEXT module on our test Pyboard. But this could be plug as easily with the ESP8266-EVB board.

## Port UEXT

The wiring of an UEXT Port on ESP8266 is described in the [UEXT folder](../UEXT/readme_eng.md) of this GitHub.

The [UEXT adapter for MicroPython Pyboard](https://github.com/mchobby/pyboard-driver/tree/master/UEXT) is also available in the (Pyboard-Driver)[https://github.com/mchobby/pyboard-driver] GitHub.

# Library

The library must be copied on the MicroPython board before using the examples.

On a WiFi capable plateform:

```
>>> import mip
>>> mip.install("github:mchobby/esp8266-upy/modirtemp")
```

Or via the mpremote utility :

```
mpremote mip install github:mchobby/esp8266-upy/modirtemp
```

# Test
To test the sensor just copy the files `mlx90614.py` (the driver) and `mlxtest.py` to the micropython board,

the following command can key key-in from the REPL session `import mlxtest`

Which produce the following result with my cup of coffee:

```
raw_values (Ambiant, Object) (24.25, 24.95001)
Ambiant T°: 24.250 C
Object  T°: 24.950 C

Ambiant T°     Object  T°    
24.250 C        24.950 C       
24.270 C        24.990 C       
24.210 C        24.930 C   
... placing the sensor in the front of the cup
