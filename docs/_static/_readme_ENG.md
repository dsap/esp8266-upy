# Plateform Agnostic MicroPython Driver

Initially, this collection of driver + wiring were created for ESP8266 running under MicroPython. The reason for this repository "esp8266-upy" name.

Since, the collection widely evolved and drivers are written to work independently from the target [MicroPython plateform](https://shop.mchobby.be/fr/56-micropython).

__MIP ready!__ The libraries can be installed with the [MIP Tool](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/packages.html) (__MicroPython Install Package__).

# Available libraries
Here is a description of the libraries available in this repository. <strong>Each sub-folders contain README file with additionnal informations about the driver, examples and wiring.</strong>
