# Use a 16 keys membrane keypad with MicroPython PyBoard

A membrane Keypad is made of matrix with lines and columns with the keys at the various intersections.  

![Keypad 4x4](docs/_static/keypad4x4.jpg)

This kind of interface can be used to create simple and efficent input interface.

It is easy to put such hardware at work with some digital input/output (8 in this case).

# Library

The library must be copied on the MicroPython board before using the examples.

On a WiFi capable plateform:

```
>>> import mip
>>> mip.install("github:mchobby/esp8266-upy/keypad-4x4")
```

Or via the mpremote utility :

```
mpremote mip install github:mchobby/esp8266-upy/keypad-4x4
```

# Wiring

![Keypad to Pyboard](docs/_static/keypad-to-pyboard.jpg)

* Lines (1-4): X5-X8 setup as __OUPUT__ (with 1 KOhms protective resistor)
* Columns (1-4): Y9-Y12 setup as __INPUT__ (with PullUp)

# Test
First, you will need to copy the `keypad.py` library on the MicroPython file system. It is possible to use the `Keypad.read()` method to read te pressure on a key.

The `Keypad4x4.read_key()` method goes further and will returns the label of the label of the pressed key ("1","2", ... "A", "B", ... "*", "# ").

``` Python
""" Continuously tries to read a key on 4x4 keypad """
from keypad import Keypad4x4
from time import sleep

k = Keypad4x4()

while True:
	# remove the 'timeout' parameter for infinite timeout
	key = k.read_key( timeout=2 )
	print( key )
```
see also the examples [`test_scan.py`](examples/test_scan.py) which scan the matrix and [`test_entercode.py`](examples/test_entercode.py) which allow to key-in a code on the keypad.
